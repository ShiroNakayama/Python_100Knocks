As a lead who is no stranger to roles requiring corsets and historical dress, Knightley along with a mostly English cast discover a surprising amount of continental charm that hews refreshingly close to a Parisian sensibility.
This is a film that has been custom-designed to give viewers all of the feels and jerk as many tears as allowed by law but the only thing I felt while watching it was utter contempt.
Relentlessly cruel, unbelievably cloying, unabashedly sentimental and frustratingly facile.
